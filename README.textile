h1. DudeNZB - Yet another Cocoa hellanzb frontend

DudeNZB is my first try to build a real world Cocoa app using MacRuby. It is a
frontend to the XMLRPC API from "hellanzb":http://www.hellanzb.com/trac/.

h2. Requirements

Right now there are no binary files ready to install. You must clone this repository
and open it with XCode. You'll need:

* a Mac
* Xcode
* Macruby 0.4 installed (get it "here":http://www.macruby.org/)
* luck

h2. Status

Very incomplete yet. Just a proof of concept for now.
